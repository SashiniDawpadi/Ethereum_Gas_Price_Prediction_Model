# Ethereum Gas Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict gas prices on the Ethereum blockchain. The model uses historical data to forecast future gas prices, helping users optimize transaction costs and timing. The notebook can be opened and run directly in Google Colab, providing an accessible and cloud-based environment for experimentation and learning.

## Introduction
In this notebook, you will learn how to use a machine learning model to predict gas prices on the Ethereum network. The model leverages techniques such as feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation to provide accurate predictions. This project is particularly useful for developers, traders, and anyone interested in optimizing Ethereum transaction costs.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of historical Ethereum gas prices. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/himselfthedecker/ethereum-value-blockchain-analysis/input). This dataset contains various features that are essential for accurate gas price prediction, such as block number, timestamp, gas limit, gas used, and gas price.

## Setup
To run this notebook, you donâ€™t need to install anything locally. You can open and execute the notebook directly in Google Colab, which provides a cloud-based environment with all necessary dependencies pre-installed.

## Running on Google Colab
Follow these steps to run the notebook on Google Colab:

1. **Open the Notebook on GitHub**:
- Navigate to the notebook file (`Gas_Cost_Optimization.ipynb`) on the GitHub repository.

2. **Open with Colab**:
- Once you are viewing the notebook file on GitHub, you will see an `Open in Colab` button if available, or you can manually open it in Colab by replacing `github.com` in the URL with `colab.research.google.com/github/`. For example:
  
  ```
